Dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 When Life Gives You Tangerines, and I gotta say, it was something else. You ever think a  ’s gonna hit you one way, and then suddenly it just sucker punches you from a different angle? Like, I thought it'd be one of those feel-good 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴, but man, there were twists I didn’t see coming. You gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and check it out. Worth it, seriously.

> There’s this part where the main character is like, standing in the rain, having this existential crisis, and you're just there like, “Bro, been there.” Isn’t it wild how a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 about tangerines somehow ends up being about all the stuff you didn't even know you wanted to think about? It’s got those moments where you're laughing, then suddenly you're questioning all your life choices.

Speaking of life choices, I was halfway through a second slice of pizza, and I realized maybe 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨  s about fruit isn’t the healthiest thing to do while shoving carbs in my face. But hey, who cares, right? Life is short, might as well 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and munch on something tasty.

And the ending, wow, I’m not giving it away, but it’s like this culmination of madness that somehow makes perfect sense. I even replayed the last ten minutes just to wrap my head around it. Like, how does someone come up with this stuff? Freakin’ genius.

int main() { return 0; }

Anyway, I’m still processing the whole thing. I might need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again, you know? But in the daylight this time, maybe the dark just makes everything hit harder. I’ll catch you later, gonna go lie down and let this tangerine metaphor swim around my brain for a bit.
